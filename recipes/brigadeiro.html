    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is a classic Brazilian sweet with an incredibly easy recipe. You'll fall in love with this delicious
        treat at first bite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 14-ounce (397 grams) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt to enhance the flavor</li>
        <li>Chocolate sprinkles or any other you prefer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grease a plate with butter and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium non-stick pan, combine the condensed milk, butter, and cocoa powder in medium heat and mix it
            well.</li>
        <li>The mixture thickens after about 10-12 minutes, and once you can run your silicone spatula through the
            middle of it without it running back together for 2-3 seconds, it is done.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture onto the lightly greased plate and let it chill in the fridge for an hour.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, prepare the candy cups and place the sprinkles in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, you are ready to roll the little balls. Lightly wet your hands, put a tablespoon of the chewy
            mixture on your hands, and roll into a small ball.</li>
        <li>Roll it over the sprinkles.</li>
        <li>Place the balls in the candy cups, and voila! Enjoy it!</li>
