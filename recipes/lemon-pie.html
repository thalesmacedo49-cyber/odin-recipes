    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Graham Cracker Crust</li>
        <li>Condensed Milk</li>
        <li>Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Whipped Cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Time needed: 2 hours and 20 minutes</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the Crust</strong></li>
        Preheat your oven. Combine the graham cracker crumbs with the butter and sugar until they have a wet sand
        consistency.

        <li><strong>Bake the Crust</strong></li>
        Press the crust mixture into an 8-inch pie dish. Bake for 7 minutes.

        <li><strong>Mix Lemon Filling</strong></li>
        While the crust is baking, combine the condensed milk, sour cream, and lemon juice in a large bowl. Whisk until
        completely smooth.

        <li><strong>Fill Crust</strong></li>
        After baking, allow the crust to cool for a few minutes then pour the filling into the baked crust.

        <li><strong>Bake the Filling</strong></li>
        Return the filled crust to the oven and bake for an additional 5-8 minutes. You are looking for tiny bubbles
        just beginning to form. Keep an eye on it because you don’t want to let the pie brown at all.

        <li><strong>Fill to Set</strong></li>
        Cool the pie for a bit, then refrigerate uncovered for at least 2 hours, or until the filling is completely set.

        <li><strong>Decorate and Serve</strong></li>
        Pipe whipped cream around the edge of the set pie and serve. Keep the pie chilled when not serving.
    </ol>
